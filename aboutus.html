  <h3>My name is Lisette Tapia and I am 15 years old. Ever since I was in middle school at age 12, I have had a great interest in computer science; when I was in a blended Spanish/Coding course. I learned how to code using HTML and from there created multiple projects like coding a drawing from scratch (Ex: Ice-Cream Cone) using color and specific details. I learned several languages of code including: CSS, Python, HTML, and JavaScript. Ever since then, I have been passionate and interested in computer science. When I first started it was all new to me, but as I continued learning from lessons, I knew that this was something that will be in my life from now on. Currently, this year I am participating in a class during school called Tech Crew, where groups of students come together to create projects or showcases at school. In Tech Crew, there are different departments; the Coders/Programmers, the Graphic Designers, the Filmmakers, and the Project Managers. As a coder, I am trying to do many computer science related contests or competitions and help other departments. For example, for Digital Dance, the coders and all departments come together to create a project that involves dancing and technology. They create things like a skirt, for instance, and figure out how to connect code with it. For the skirts, they ended up using LED stripes to make the skirts light up so the dancers can look all coordinated with it. Since I'm a coder, I also helps out the school by participating in Hour of Code; where I teaches a group of students how to code and help them out. I have been participating in Hour of Code for two years now. My goals for the future is to attend college and major in computer science for media and help the population of women in STEM to rise higher. I also want to continue creating projects that can help change the world to become a better society
